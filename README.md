We may select certain points to create the representations of only the most informative attributes of an image. 
These informative attributes, or points of interest, are points that are surrounded by rich textures and can be reproduced without affecting the image.
Edges and corners are two common types of points of interest. An edge is a boundary at which pixel intensity rapidly changes, and a corner is an intersection of two edges.
